! Error when you keep pulling to refresh the main page
! Scrolling down on the main screen scrolls all the way down
	-> could this be an emulator problem?
! Problem where the first swipe to refresh has no effect, however, the second refresh
	is triggered when you try to scroll up at the beginning of the feedpost, which is
	the desired effect

$ Made every page (dash, friends, stats, add friends) refresh its activity without having to
	display the start of every activity. [Still don't have pull down to refresh]

### 02/17/2017 ###
$ edited res/layout/activity_main.xml -> added a nested ListView
$ MainActivity.java -> following tutorial (bignerdranch and androidAPI)


### 02/10/2017 ###
$ Dashboard - goTo... (lines 180+)

Going to start on fixing the back button. As of right now, the back button exits out of the app.
- finish(): ending the activity; also ties in to refreshing the page
