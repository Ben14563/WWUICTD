$ Made every page (dash, friends, stats, add friends) refresh its activity without having to
	display the start of every activity. [Still don't have pull down to refresh]

### 02/17/2017 ###
$ edited res/layout/activity_main.xml -> added a nested ListView
$ MainActivity.java -> following tutorial (bignerdranch and androidAPI)


### 02/10/2017 ###
$ Dashboard - goTo... (lines 180+)

Going to start on fixing the back button. As of right now, the back button exits out of the app.
- finish(): ending the activity; also ties in to refreshing the page
